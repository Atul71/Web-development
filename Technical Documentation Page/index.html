                <p>What is Python?
                Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
                It is used for:
                </p>
                <li>web development (server-side)</li>
                <li>software development</li>
                <li>mathematics</li>
                <li>system scripting</li>    
                <li>machine learning</li> 
                <br>
                <p>
                    Python is a high-level general purpose programming language that offers multiple paradigms like object-orientation, and structural and functional programming for software development. It works on cross-platform operating systems and can be used across to develop a wide range of applications including those intended for image processing, text processing, web, and enterprise level using scientific, numeric and data from network. BitTorrent, YouTube, Dropbox, Deluge, Cinema 4D and Bazaar are a few globally-used applications based on Python.

                <header><h2>Install</h2></header>
                <p>Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.
                To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):
                </p>
                &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp
                C:\Users\Your Name>python --version
               <p>
                If you find that you do not have python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: https://www.python.org/

            <section class="main-section" id="Indentations">
                <header><h2>Indentations</h2></header><p>
                Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, in Python the indentation is very important.

                Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
                <p>
                    To indicate a block of code in Python, you must indent each line of the block by the same amount. The two blocks of code in our example if-statement are both indented four spaces, which is a typical amount of indentation for Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In most other programming languages, indentation is used only to help make the code look pretty. But in Python, it is required for indicating what block of code a statement belongs to. For instance, the final print('All done!') is not indented, and so is not part of the else-block.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's often stated that indentation is an important part of programming practice and programmerâ€™s should follow It from the starting of their programming career.

            <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
                <header><h2>Variables</h2></header><p>
                Variables are containers for storing data values.

                Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

                A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
                <code>
                    x = 5
                </code> 
                Python can store variables as a list also
                <br>   
                <code>
                    thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                </code>

                <h4>Gui Based Desktop Applications:</h4>
                <p>
                    Python has simple syntax, modular architecture, rich text processing tools and the ability to work on multiple operating systems which make it a desirable choice for developing desktop-based applications. There are various GUI toolkits like wxPython, PyQt or PyGtk available which help developers create highly functional Graphical User Interface (GUI). The various applications developed using Python includes:
                    <li>Image Processing and Graphic Design Applications:</li>
                    <li>Scientific and Computational Applications:</li>
                    <li>Games</li>
                </p>
                <h4>Web Frameworks and Web Applications:</h4>
                <p>Python has been used to create a variety of web-frameworks including CherryPy, Django, TurboGears, Bottle, Flask etc. These frameworks provide standard libraries and modules which simplify tasks related to content management, interaction with database and interfacing with different internet protocols such as HTTP, SMTP</p>
                <h4>
                    Prototyping
                </h4>
                <p>Besides being quick and easy to learn, Python also has the open source advantage of being free with the support of a large community. This makes it the preferred choice for prototype development. Further, the agility, extensibility and scalability and ease of refactoring code associated with Python allow faster development from initial prototype.</p>
                <p>
                   Since its origin in 1989, Python has grown to become part of a plethora of web-based, desktop-based, graphic design, scientific, and computational applications. With Python available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux / UNIX, it offers ease of development for enterprises. Additionally, the latest release Python 3.4.3 builds on the existing strengths of the language, with drastic improvement in Unicode support, among other new features.

                    There are three numeric types in Python:
                    <li>int</li>
                    <code>x = 1 <br>
                    </code>
